- **Alien Fleet**: Engage with multiple rows of descending aliens that increase in speed and complexity as the game progresses.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Fire bullets to eliminate aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for each alien destroyed and track your high scores.
